# API Contract Baseline

This document defines a contributor-facing API baseline for Claw-Empire.
It is intentionally compact and focused on frequently used endpoints.
Current baseline target: `v1.2.4` (local snapshot, 2026-02-28).

## Base

- Base URL (local): `http://127.0.0.1:8790`
- API prefix: `/api`
- Health endpoint: `/healthz`
- Swagger UI: `/api/docs`
- OpenAPI JSON: `/api/openapi.json`

## Authentication

- Loopback/local usage usually works without extra headers.
- Remote/non-loopback deployments can require:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <API_AUTH_TOKEN>`
- Inbox webhook endpoint requires:
  - `x-inbox-secret: <INBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`
- Browser session bootstrap (`GET /api/auth/session`) returns `csrf_token`.
  - For cookie-authenticated mutation requests (`POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`), send:
    - `x-csrf-token: <csrf_token>`
- Interrupt injection endpoint (`POST /api/tasks/:id/inject`) additionally requires:
  - `session_id`
  - `interrupt_token` (or header `x-task-interrupt-token`)
  - Terminal API (`GET /api/tasks/:id/terminal`) exposes `interrupt.session_id` + `interrupt.control_token`
- Swagger note:
  - `/api/docs` opens with an automatic `/api/auth/session` bootstrap attempt (loopback/local case).
  - If you still get `401 unauthorized`, set `Bearer <API_AUTH_TOKEN>` via Swagger `Authorize`.

## Common Error Shape

Error payloads can vary by route, but API clients should handle:

```json
{
  "error": "error_code",
  "message": "human-readable detail"
}
```

The frontend client wraps non-2xx responses with `ApiRequestError` (`status`, `code`, `details`, `url`).

## Messenger Session Contract (v1.2.3)

Messenger channel settings are stored in `settings.key = "messengerChannels"` and can include:

- `token`: channel token (encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, fallback: `SESSION_SECRET`)
- `sessions[]`:
  - `id`
  - `name`
  - `targetId`
  - `enabled` (default true)
  - `agentId` (optional, binds session to a specific agent for direct chat/task routing)

Supported channel ids (OpenClaw parity):

- `telegram`
- `whatsapp`
- `discord`
- `googlechat`
- `slack`
- `signal`
- `imessage`

Runtime behavior highlights:

- Task report relays are route-pinned to the task's originating messenger target (`[messenger-route]` audit marker in task logs).
- Channel spread is prevented for route-pinned task reports.
- Typing indicators are emitted during direct-chat generation for Telegram/Discord; other channels are no-op.
- Native direct send runtime exists for all OpenClaw-parity channels (`telegram`, `whatsapp`, `discord`, `googlechat`, `slack`, `signal`, `imessage`).
- Per-channel setup requirements differ (e.g., WhatsApp Cloud API token + phone number id, Google Chat webhook URL or `key|token`, Signal RPC base URL, macOS iMessage runtime).
- New project creation path in direct-chat escalation is restricted by `PROJECT_PATH_ALLOWED_ROOTS`.

## Known Follow-up

- Promote this baseline to OpenAPI (`/api/*.yaml`) in incremental slices:
  1. auth/session + settings
  2. tasks/subtasks
  3. inbox/directives
  4. project/github/update routes
